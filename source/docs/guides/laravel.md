# Laravel Guide

Although Pest is framework agnostic, it was built with Laravel in mind. In this guide, we are going
to see how can you create tests with the elegance you expect, and
with the convenience you love.

Once you [install Pest](/docs/installation) in your Laravel application, and because Pest is a **progressive testing framework**,
your current test suite will still work, even if you run it with the `./vendor/bin/pest` console command.

Now, let's get started by taking a look at Laravel's default test suite:

```bash
- tests
    - Feature
        - ExampleTest.php
    - Unit
        - ExampleTest.php
    - CreatesApplication.php
    - TestCase.php
- phpunit.xml
```

First, let's run the `pest:install` artisan command:
```bash
php artisan pest:install
```

This command will create the `Pest.php` file with the following code:
```php
<?php

uses(Tests\TestCase::class)->in('Feature');
```

Next, let's migrate the `tests/Unit/ExampleTest.php` file to Pest:
```php
<?php

test('basic')->assertTrue(true);
```

And now, the `tests/Feature/ExampleTest.php` file:
```php
<?php

it('has welcome page')
    ->get('/')
    ->assertStatus(200);
```

And that's it! You should now have a fresh Laravel installation with
a Pest test suite.

## Artisan commands

### `pest:install`

The `pest:install` Artisan command creates the `test/Pest.php` file in your tests folder:

```
php artisan pest:install
```

As described on the [Underlying Test Case](/docs/underling-test-case) section,
the `Pest.php` file is the place where all your `uses` should live.

### `pest:test`

The `pest:test <name>` Artisan command creates a new test in the `tests/Feature` folder:

```
php artisan pest:test UsersTest
```

Optionally, you can provide the `--unit` option to create the
given test under the `tests/Unit` folder:

```
php artisan pest:test UsersTest --unit
```

### `pest:dataset`

The `pest:dataset` Artisan command creates a new dataset in the `tests/Datasets` folder:

```
php artisan pest:dataset Emails
```

As detailed on the [Datasets](/docs/datasets) section, datasets allow you to
run the same test multiple times with different data.

## Traits

As explained in the [Underlying Test Case](/docs/underlying-test-case) section, the usage
of traits in Pest is possible with the `uses` function:

```
<?php

use App\User;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\RefreshDatabase;

uses(RefreshDatabase::class);

beforeEach(fn () => factory(User::class)->create());

it('has users')->assertDatabaseHas('users', [
    'id' => 1,
]);
```

Keep in mind that you can avoid the `uses(RefreshDatabase::class)`
line in your test by [binding it](/docs/underlying-test-case) in your `Pest.php` file.
