# Global Assertions Plugin

The Global Assertions Plugin for Pest provides global functions for assertions that were removed in v0.2

**Source code**: [github.com/pestphp/pest-plugin-global-assertions](https://github.com/pestphp/pest-plugin-global-assertions)

Install the plugin using Composer:

```bash
composer require pestphp/pest-plugin-global-assertions --dev
```

This allows you to do the following, without calling the `$this` object. For a full list of available methods, please refer to [the compiled list](https://github.com/pestphp/pest-plugin-global-assertions/blob/main/src/compiled.php).

```php
it('asserts true is true using global function', function () {
    assertTrue(true);
});
```

This plugin is a good temporary helper when upgrading to [the Expectations API](/docs/expectations) in Pest v0.3
