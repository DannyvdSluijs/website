# Installation

## Install Pest on a blank project

> **Note:** Pest requires [PHP 7.3+](https://php.net/releases/) to work.

1. Inside a new directory, set up your project with composer:

```bash
composer init
```

2. Make sure your new `composer.json` file contains the following options:

```json
"minimum-stability": "dev",
"prefer-stable": true,
```

3. Install Pest:

```bash
composer require pestphp/pest --dev
```

4. Initialise your test environement:

```bash
./vendor/bin/pest --init
```

Under the hood, this Pest command will create the following:

- a `tests` directory,
- a `phpunit.xml` file,
- a `tests/Pest.php` file,
- a `tests/Helpers.php` file,
- a `tests/ExampleTest.php` file,

5. Finally, you can run Pest directly from the command line:

```bash
./vendor/bin/pest
```

## Install Pest on an existing project

> **Note:** Pest requires [PHP 7.3+](https://php.net/releases/) to work.

1. Make sure your existing `composer.json` file contains the following options:

```json
"minimum-stability": "dev",
"prefer-stable": true,
```

2. Then, make sure your _PHPUnit_ dependency is set to `^9.0`:

```bash
composer require phpunit/phpunit:"^9.0" --dev --update-with-dependencies
```

3. If you don't have a `phpunit.xml` file, [download this file](https://github.com/pestphp/pest/blob/master/stubs/Laravel/phpunit.xml) and place it on the root of your project.

4. **If you are using Laravel**, make sure your _Collision_ dependency is set to `^5.0`:

```bash
composer require nunomaduro/collision:"^5.0" --dev --update-with-dependencies
```

5. Next, require **Pest**:

```bash
composer require pestphp/pest --dev
```

6. **If you are using Laravel**, run the `pest:install` _Artisan_ command to install Pest in your test suite:

```bash
php artisan pest:install
```

**Otherwise**, run the `pest --init` command to install Pest in your test suite:

```bash
./vendor/bin/pest --init
```

7. Finally, you can run Pest directly from the command line:

```bash
./vendor/bin/pest
```
